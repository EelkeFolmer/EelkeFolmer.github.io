	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I went to the University of Groningen and studied biology. I now work as an ecological researcher at the Netherlands 
           Institute for Sea Research on Texel. I live in Lemmer in Fryslan. In my free time I like to travel, go sailing, fly my drones and spend 
           time with my family and friends.</p>
